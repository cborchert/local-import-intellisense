# local-import-intellisense README

A VSCode extension (in the making) to make local imports in large projects easier.

Note that almost everything in this repo is based on the excellent work of Christian Kohler's more or less essential extension [NpmIntellisense](https://github.com/ChristianKohler/NpmIntellisense). Go say thank you.

## To use (Basic)

For the moment we're in the very early stages. Download or clone the repo, install any dependencies using `yarn install`, open the project in VSCode and spin up a demo using `CMD + F5`

## Features

`// TODO: write features ðŸ‘€`

### Command: Insert Import Statement

`CMD+SHIFT+P` then type "Insert Import Statement" and hit `Enter`. A quickPick dialog will pop up to help you out!

### Intellisense

Type a standard Import statement in a javascript or typescript file. When you get to the quotes, the intellisense will come to life !

## Requirements

`// TODO: write requirements. Can you extend extensions? In that case, this might be better as an extension to NpmIntellisense, honestly.`

## Extension Settings

`// TODO: make extension have settings`
`// TODO: write extension settings`

## Known Issues

None! because I haven't written any unit tests, and no one has ever used this.

`// TODO: write unit tests`

## Release Notes

...still in the early stages: no releases yet ðŸ˜„
